      "abstract": "BACKGROUND \/ AIMS  The development of colorectal cancer and a variable range of extracolonic manifestations in familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is the result of the dominant inheritance of adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene mutations . In this study , direct mutation analysis of the APC gene was performed to determine genotype-phenotype correlations for nine extracolonic manifestations and to investigate the incidence of APC mutations in non-FAP colorectal cancer . METHODS  The APC gene was analysed in 190 unrelated FAP and 15 non-FAP colorectal cancer patients using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis , the protein truncation test , and direct sequencing . RESULTS  Chain terminating signals were only identified in patients belonging to the FAP group ( 105 patients ) . Amino acid changes were identified in four patients , three of whom belonged to the non-FAP group of colorectal cancer patients . Genotype-phenotype correlations identified significant differences in the nature of certain extracolonic manifestations in FAP patients belonging to three mutation subgroups . CONCLUSIONS  Extended genotype-phenotype correlations made in this study may have the potential to determine the most appropriate surveillance and prophylactic treatment regimens for those patients with mutations associated with life threatening conditions . This study also provided evidence for the pathological nature of amino acid changes in APC associated with both FAP and non-FAP colorectal cancer patients . .",
