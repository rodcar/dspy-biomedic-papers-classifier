      "abstract": "Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , a disorder of amino acid metabolism prevalent among Caucasians and other ethnic groups , is caused primarily by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . PKU is a highly heterogeneous disorder , with more than 60 molecular lesions identified in the PAH gene . The haplotype associations , relative frequencies , and distributions of five prevalent PAH mutations ( R158Q , R261Q , IVS10nt546 , R408W , and IVS12n1 ) were established in a comprehensive European sample population and subsequently were examined to determine the potential roles of several genetic mechanisms in explaining the present distribution of the major PKU alleles . Each of these five mutations was strongly associated with only one of the more than 70 chromosomal haplotypes defined by eight RFLPs in or near the PAH gene . These findings suggest that each of these mutations arose through a single founding event that occurred within time periods ranging from several hundred to several thousand years ago . From the significant differences observed in the relative frequencies and distributions of these five alleles throughout Europe , four of these putative founding events could be localized to specific ethnic subgroups . Together , these data suggest that there were multiple , geographically and ethnically distinct origins for PKU within the European population . .",
